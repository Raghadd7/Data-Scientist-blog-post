## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda
distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python
versions 3.*.

The libraries used:

* pandas
* matplotlib
* plotly
* sklearn

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I have used the kickstarter projects data from 2009 to 2018
to better understand:

1. What are the categories of successful projects ?
2. Dose time of the year the project is launched affect its success and
influenced more people to donate ?
3. What are the most important features in determining the projectâ€™s success?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a jupyter notebook file (Data Science post.ipynb) available here to
showcase work related to the above questions.

There is a data visualization folder that contains screen shots of the
visualization used in this analysis.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://raghad-a-otaibi.medium.com/the-aspects-of-successful-crowdfunding-projects-1e49435152af).
